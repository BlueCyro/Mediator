# Mediator
Universal websocket control interface for universal media controls

This is a simple, yet mildly useful tool for controlling media playback over a websocket.

Commands are as follows:
- playpause
- next
- prev
- close

The first 3 are fairly self-explanatory, the last one just closes the websocket connection.

Default port is 9070, launching the exe with a number after it defines a new port.
